To run the script:

1- Open bash and go to the directory which the zip file is located.
2- Execute "unzip HW1_saydemia.zip"
3- Execute "ls" . Make sure that the directory you are currently in has the following files.
	
 DIR|
	|-- mergesort.cpp
	|-- insertsort.cpp
	|-- mergeTime.cpp
	|-- insertTime.cpp 
	|-- data.txt
	|-- sorted.txt
	|-- HW1_cpp.sh

4- Execute "chmod 700 HW1_cpp.sh". This gives admin privileges to executable. (can be skipped)
5- Execute "HW1_cpp.sh". (If you skipped step 4, you have to run the script with "sh HW1_cpp.sh")
